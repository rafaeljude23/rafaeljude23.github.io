          </div>
          
          <div class="services-content">
            <p>Oceanic Risk Management is your dedicated partner for creating dynamic, resilient business continuity plans (BCPs). We offer tailored plans to navigate unforeseen challenges, ensuring your business thrives even in the most uncertain circumstances.</p>

            <div class="services-list">
              <h4 class="title-icon"><img src="images/urban-planning.svg" alt="">Tailored Business Continuity Planning</h4>
              <p>Our strength lies in understanding the unique needs of your business and creating a BCP that reflects them. Our team of experts works closely with your business to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Identify potential risks and disruptions</li>
                <li>Develop strategies to maintain critical functions during and after a crisis</li>
                <li>Create response teams ready to tackle potential crises</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            

            <p>For instance, a tech start-up we worked with faced a critical risk of data breaches and system failures. Our customised BCP allowed them to maintain operations, quickly recover, and strengthen their market position by demonstrating resilience during a significant cyber attack.</p>

            <h4 class="title-icon"><img src="images/support.svg" alt="">Ongoing Support and Refinements</h4>
            <p>At Oceanic, we understand that a business continuity plan is not a static document. It evolves with your business. Therefore, we offer ongoing support to refine and update your BCP to reflect your business's changing needs and operational landscape.</p>

            <h4 class="title-icon"><img src="images/quality-assurance.svg" alt="">Compliance Assurance</h4>
            <p>We stay updated with the latest industry regulations and standards, ensuring your BCP meets all necessary compliance requirements. This helps mitigate legal and regulatory risks and enhances your business's reputation among stakeholders.</p>

            <h4 class="title-icon"><img src="images/training.svg" alt="">Training and Awareness</h4>
            <p>A BCP is only as effective as the team that implements it. That's why we provide training and awareness sessions to ensure your team understands and can effectively implement the plan during a crisis.</p>

            <p>With Oceanic Risk Management's Business Continuity Planning, you get a plan and a partner committed to seeing you thrive amidst uncertainties. Equip your business with the resilience to survive and seize opportunities in any crisis.</p>
